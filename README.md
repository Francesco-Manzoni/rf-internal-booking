## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This project implements a comprehensive testing strategy demonstrating best practices in frontend testing:

### Unit Testing (Vitest + Testing Library)

- **Component Testing** - All major components have dedicated test suites
- **Custom Hooks Testing** - Business logic hooks thoroughly tested
- **Utility Functions** - Helper functions with edge case coverage
- **Accessibility Testing** - Screen reader and keyboard navigation tests

### Integration Testing (Cypress)

- **End-to-End Workflows** - Complete user journeys tested
- **Cross-browser Compatibility** - Automated browser testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🧪 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run start        # Start development server (production mode)

# Testing
npm run test         # Run unit tests with Vitest
npm run cy:run       # Run E2E tests with Cypress (requires app running)

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Lint code with ESLint
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run check        # Run both formatting and linting

# Production
npm run build        # Build optimized production bundle
npm run serve        # Preview production build locally
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

This project demonstrates several advanced architectural patterns:

### File-Based Routing
